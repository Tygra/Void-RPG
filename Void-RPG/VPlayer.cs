 *  The plugin has some features which I got from other authors.
 *  I don't claim any ownership over those elements which were made by someone else.
 *  The plugin has been customized to fit our need at Geldar,
 *  and because of this, it's useless for anyone else.
 *  I know timers are shit, and If someone knows a way to keep them after relog, tell me.
